This paper presents exploratory research on temporally dynamic patterns of vowel nasalization from two speakers of Arabana. 
To derive a dynamic measure of nasality, we use gradient tree boosting algorithms to statistically learn the mapping between acoustics and vowel nasality in a speaker-specific manner. 
Three primary findings emerge: (1) NVN contexts exhibit nasalization throughout the entirety of the vowel interval, and we propose that a similar co-articulatory realization previously acted to resist diachronic change in this environment; 
(2) anticipatory vowel nasalization is nearly as extensive as carryover vowel nasalization, which is contrary to previous claims; 
and (3) the degree of vowel nasalization in word-initial contexts is relatively high, even in the #_C environment, suggesting that the ongoing sound change *#ŋa > #a has involved the loss of the oral constriction associated with ŋ but not the complete loss of the velum gesture.
