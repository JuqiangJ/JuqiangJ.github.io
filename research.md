### Research directions
***
#### 1、Language and well-being
My research in this area centers on the discourse production, particularly in individuals with Chinese aphasia and elderly Chinese speakers. I explore the phonetic, semantic, and grammatical aspects of language to understand how these elements are affected by aging and neurological conditions. The ultimate goal is to apply these insights to develop reliable methods for assessing language abilities and creating intelligent systems for early screening of cognitive impairments.

#### 2、Second language speech learning
In my work on second language (L2) acquisition, I investigate how factors, such as language background, and talker variability, affect the learning of L2 phonetics. Through speech perception and production experiments, I aim to construct computational models that predict learning challenges in L2 speech learning, providing insights to improve L2 teaching practices and learning outcomes.

#### 3、Digital humanity
My research in digital humanities relies on data science techniques to quantitatively analyse texts and explore their stylistic or semantic features, and translation styles.
